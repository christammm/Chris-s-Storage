# Python_Practice

This is the master folder that will contain all of our PyCharm project folders.
Each sub-folder within will be a separate PyCharm project.

The purpose of this folder is for us to collaboratively learn Python. Ultimately, the goal
is to become proficient enough in Python, as well as C such that we can understand the
linv1 Linker, and translate it to Python.

Everyone who has access to this filesystem will have full access to everything, so PLEASE BE
CAREFUL when editing and deleting files. Also, when committing and coding, please write
meaningful comments so that we cna UNDERSTAND each other's work.
